# ts-mtwister

A direct TypeScript translation of the Mersenne Twister with the *6069 LCG seeding constant.

If you find this project useful, you can support this and further ports at [ko-fi.com/scottmoore0](https://ko-fi.com/scottmoore0).

## Usage

This is a direct translation of [ESultanik/mtwister](https://github.com/ESultanik/mtwister) from C to TypeScript. The public API, state struct, and per-call output are preserved as faithfully as possible.

To read more about mtwister, please see the [original mtwister repository](https://github.com/ESultanik/mtwister).

The key differences from the C version are:
- **Zero dependencies** - all C standard library shims (memory management, integer arithmetic helpers) are contained in the source itself.
- **No manual memory management** - JavaScript's garbage collector replaces `malloc`/`free`.
- **ES modules** - files are linked with standard `import`/`export` statements.
- **Per-call state object** - `seedRand` returns a state instance you pass into `genRand`/`genRandLong`, mirroring the upstream `MTRand r = seedRand(...)` idiom.
- **Single-threaded** - JavaScript's event loop model means thread-safety concerns from the C version do not apply.

## Installation

Install from npm:

```bash
npm install ts-mtwister
```

Or install with your preferred package manager:

```bash
yarn add ts-mtwister
pnpm add ts-mtwister
```

Alternatively, because the core library is contained in a single self-contained file, you can copy it directly into your project:

```bash
cp mtwister.ts /path/to/your/project/src/
```

Or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ScottMoore0/ts-mtwister.git
```

## Importing

When installed from npm:

```typescript
import { seedRand, genRand, genRandLong } from 'ts-mtwister';
```

When using the source file directly:

```typescript
import { seedRand, genRand, genRandLong } from './mtwister.js';
```

### Quick example

```typescript
import { seedRand, genRand } from 'ts-mtwister';

const state = seedRand(5489);
console.log(genRand(state));
// 0.40178815517616184
```

## Building

Unlike the original C version, ts-mtwister requires no compilation step. It is valid TypeScript (and JavaScript) source code that runs directly in Node.js, Deno, Bun, or modern browsers.

## TypeScript Compiler

If your project uses TypeScript, add the file to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "strict": false,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"]
}
```

> **Important:** The translated code uses patterns that emulate C pointer arithmetic and unsafe type casts. It is intentionally **not** `strict`-compliant. You should isolate it in its own module (as shown above) and wrap it in a strictly-typed API surface for the rest of your application.

## Node.js / tsx

Run directly without pre-compilation:

```bash
npx tsx mtwister.ts
```

Or with Deno:

```bash
deno run --allow-all mtwister.ts
```

## Bundling

Because the library is self-contained with zero `npm` dependencies, it bundles cleanly with esbuild, Rollup, or Vite:

```bash
npx esbuild mtwister.ts --bundle --platform=node --outfile=dist/mtwister.js
```

## Data Structure

The C `struct MTRand` has been translated to a TypeScript class with identical fields:

```typescript
class tagMTRand {
  mt: number[] = [];   // 624-word state vector
  index: number = 0;   // next-output index (0..624)
}
```

`seedRand(seed)` returns a fresh `tagMTRand` instance; `genRand(state)` and `genRandLong(state)` mutate it on each call.

## Tests

The repository includes the upstream mtwister reference vectors and the translated test framework. To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Test data is located in:
- `tests/` - per-call output vectors for seed `5489`, validated against the original ESultanik C build.

## Caveats

The following limitations from the original C version still apply:

- **Not canonical MT19937.** ESultanik's `mtwister` uses Knuth's older `*6069` linear-congruential seeding constant rather than MT19937's `*1812433253` recurrence. The output sequence therefore differs from textbook MT19937 implementations and from `mt19937ar.out`. If you need canonical MT19937 outputs use [`ts-mt19937`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-mt19937) instead.
- **Not cryptographically secure.** As the upstream README explicitly notes, "this code has not been tested to a sufficient extent to be confidently used for cryptography." Do not use for keys, tokens, or any security-sensitive purpose.
- **Deterministic.** Same seed produces the same sequence on every run, which is useful for reproducible simulations but not for unpredictability.

The following C-specific caveats **do not apply** to the TypeScript version:

- **Memory leaks** - JavaScript's garbage collector eliminates manual `malloc`/`free` concerns.
- **Thread safety** - JavaScript is single-threaded; no special thread-safety measures are needed.
- **C standard compliance** - The code runs wherever TypeScript/JavaScript runs (Node.js, Deno, Bun, browsers).
